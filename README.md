# Summer-Internship-II  
# IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate Portfolio  

This repository showcases the projects and skills acquired during the **IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate** program on Coursera, along with my **Summer Internship II project**.  

The certification and internship experience together provided comprehensive, hands-on training in the end-to-end lifecycle of **deep learning, generative AI, and large language models (LLMs)**. I learned to **train, fine-tune, and deploy advanced AI models**, and also applied these skills to build a **real-world AI-powered QA Chatbot**.

## üíº Final Project: Intelligent QA Chatbot with RAG & LangChain  

During my **Summer Internship II**, I worked on developing an **intelligent Question-Answering (QA) chatbot** capable of delivering **accurate, document-grounded responses** from a loaded knowledge base.  

### üîé Methodology  
1. **Document Loading**  
   - Loaded knowledge base documents (PDFs, academic papers, etc.) using **LangChain loaders**.  

2. **Text Splitting & Embeddings**  
   - Chunked large documents into smaller parts.  
   - Generated **embeddings** using **IBM watsonx AI models**.  

3. **Vector Database & Retriever**  
   - Stored embeddings in a **vector database** (FAISS/Chroma).  
   - Implemented a **retriever** to fetch relevant chunks.  

4. **LLM Integration**  
   - Used **IBM watsonx.ai LLM** for final response generation.  
   - Ensured context-based, accurate answers.  

5. **Frontend (Gradio)**  
   - Built a **user-friendly interface** for real-time interaction with the bot.  

### ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack  
- **LangChain** (document orchestration)  
- **IBM watsonx.ai** (LLM + embeddings)  
- **Vector Database** (FAISS / Chroma)  
- **Gradio** (frontend UI)  
- **Python** (backend development)  

### ‚ú® Features
