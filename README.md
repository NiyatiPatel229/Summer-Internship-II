# Summer-Internship-II  
# IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate Portfolio  

This repository showcases the projects and skills acquired during the **IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate** program on Coursera, along with my **Summer Internship II project**.  

The certification and internship experience together provided comprehensive, hands-on training in the end-to-end lifecycle of **deep learning, generative AI, and large language models (LLMs)**. I learned to **train, fine-tune, and deploy advanced AI models**, and also applied these skills to build a **real-world AI-powered QA Chatbot**.

## üöÄ Capstone Project (Coursera): Generative AI Applications with RAG and LangChain  

The **capstone project** was an end-to-end implementation of a **generative AI application** using a **RAG system**.  

**Goal**: Build a robust AI agent that provides **context-aware and accurate responses** from a custom knowledge base.  

**Highlights**:  
- Used **LangChain** to orchestrate workflows.  
- Implemented **data ingestion and indexing** pipelines.  
- Built retrieval and **response generation pipelines**.  
- Combined **deep learning fundamentals** with **modern generative AI techniques**.  

This project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of my ability to integrate multiple AI concepts into a functional, real-world application.

## üíº Summer Internship II Project: Intelligent QA Chatbot with RAG & LangChain  

During my **Summer Internship II**, I worked on developing an **intelligent Question-Answering (QA) chatbot** capable of delivering **accurate, document-grounded responses** from a loaded knowledge base.  

### üîé Methodology  
1. **Document Loading**  
   - Loaded knowledge base documents (PDFs, academic papers, etc.) using **LangChain loaders**.  

2. **Text Splitting & Embeddings**  
   - Chunked large documents into smaller parts.  
   - Generated **embeddings** using **IBM watsonx AI models**.  

3. **Vector Database & Retriever**  
   - Stored embeddings in a **vector database** (FAISS/Chroma).  
   - Implemented a **retriever** to fetch relevant chunks.  

4. **LLM Integration**  
   - Used **IBM watsonx.ai LLM** for final response generation.  
   - Ensured context-based, accurate answers.  

5. **Frontend (Gradio)**  
   - Built a **user-friendly interface** for real-time interaction with the bot.  

### ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack  
- **LangChain** (document orchestration)  
- **IBM watsonx.ai** (LLM + embeddings)  
- **Vector Database** (FAISS / Chroma)  
- **Gradio** (frontend UI)  
- **Python** (backend development)  

### ‚ú® Features  
- Handles **large-scale documents**.  
- Provides **reliable, contextually accurate answers**.  
- Fast and **scalable retrieval pipeline**.  
- Interactive **chatbot-style interface**.  

### üìä Results  
- Successfully developed a **working chatbot system**.  
- Achieved **high retrieval accuracy** with efficient performance.  
- Delivered a **production-ready prototype** for document-based QA.
